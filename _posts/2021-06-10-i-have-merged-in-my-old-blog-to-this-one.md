I started my first blog in about 2005, I think. That is now lost. Back in 2014 [I started a new one]({% post_url 2014-07-11-new-blog %}) which did not really stay active long because of all the [tweeting](https://www.twitter.com/paulanthonywils); I've just merged that into here and redirected my main url, [http://merecomplexities.com](http://merecomplexities.com).

I should really sort things out and

* get some sort of https redirection going on from `merecomplexities.com`
* make this soemething like `weblog.merecomp.com` and (https) redirect from `furloughlog.merecomplexities.com`
* make it beautiful

So, the last one isn't going to happen. I don't want to pay $300 a year for DNSimple https redirection and I don't trust the free ones. I
guess I may end up with a Digital Ocean droplet that just redirects.

(I do need to get my Let's Encrypt SSL certificate game sorted out first, though.)
