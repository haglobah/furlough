Originally started when I was furloughed from [Deliveroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliveroo) when it seems like a good idea to keep a log of what I'd been doing. A log, on the web - some kind of _web log_. Maybe this _web log_ idea will catch on; could do with a catchier name, though.

The Repo is [here](https://github.com/paulanthonywilson/furlough). Feel free to add issues or pull requests, if I've got something wrong.
