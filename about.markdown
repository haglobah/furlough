I have been furloughed since the 28th of May 2020 and I want to use the time well. This is a great opportunity to learn and embark on some personal projects.

It seems like a good idea to keep a log of what I've been doing. A log, on the web - some kind of _web log_. Maybe this _web log_ idea will catch on; could do with a catchier name, though.
