Originally started when I was furloughed from [Deliveroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliveroo) when it seems like a good idea to keep a log of what I'd been doing. A log, on the web - some kind of _web log_. Maybe this _web log_ idea will catch on; could do with a catchier name, though.

I ended up (intermittently) ~~b~~logging, here than on my old blog so as of June 2021, [I merged my old blog]({% post_url 2021-06-10-i-have-merged-in-my-old-blog-to-this-one%}) in and redirected my root domain
to here.

The Repo is [here](https://github.com/paulanthonywilson/furlough). Feel free to add issues or pull requests, if I've got something wrong.
